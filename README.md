### An Asynchronous RMI Dictionary Service

Client is running on Tomcat Server v9. The Client enters a word to search the dictionary.

The word is then passed through to a remote object on a remote server to search the dictionary. 
The user will recieve the result but will not have direct access to the dictionary file and the implementation is hidden from the user.

	NOTE: dictionary.csv only contains 50 words for example some are:

	Allure
	Alter
	Babble
	Bachelor
	Backboard
	Cabin
	Cable
	Each
	Gain
	Hang
	Jug
	Laboratories
	Laboratory

    In the CMD, direct to the folder where the JAR file is located and run the following command:

	          java -jar dictionary-service.jar

    The CMD shout output "server ready"
